This is my submission for the third project of the Udacity Android Nanodegree program. It contains two programs, a library app called Alexandria, and a football score viewing app. This project was created by modifying existing code provided by Udacity, and used the ZX-ing scanning code to implement the scanner.

##Alexandria
This app is able to find the information for a book, given its ISBN-13 number. This number can either be typed in or scanned. When books have been identified, they can be added to a list of books.

##Football Scores
This app is for viewing the current scores of football (soccer) games. It can also be included on the phone's home screen as a widget.
